This repository describes strategies and links to resources on earning an income with open data.

Seeded at the [DB Open-Data-Hackathon Summercamp](https://dbmindbox.com/en/db-opendata-hackathons/hackathons/db-open-data-hackathon-community-summercamp-juli-2019/) in July 2019, our original idea was to create a resource to strengthen the basis for professional engagement within the open data community.

# Data

This is a [Data Package](https://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/) tracking some active centres of value exchange (data hubs, or marketplaces), where services of creating, improving, or building on top of open data are valued and usually well compensated. It is inspired and partly based on [@engineerapart/TheRemoteFreelancer](https://github.com/engineerapart/TheRemoteFreelancer).

To view the data, click the link above. To contribute, edit the files in the `data` folder.

For more information on how Data Packages work, visit [frictionlessdata.io](https://frictionlessdata.io/guides/data-package/) and [datahub.io](https://datahub.io/docs/data-packages/publish-faq).
